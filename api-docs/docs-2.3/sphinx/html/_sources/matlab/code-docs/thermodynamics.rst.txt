        :param tp:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase` (or another
            object that derives from ThermoPhase)
        :return:
            Reference pressure in Pa. All standard-state
            thermodynamic properties are for this pressure.
        

    .. mat:function:: satPressure(tp, T)

        Get the saturation pressure for a given temperature.

        :param tp:

            object that derives from ThermoPhase)
        :param T:

            object that derives from ThermoPhase)
        :param p:
            Pressure. Units: Pa
        :return:

    .. mat:function:: set(tp, varargin)

        Set properties of a phase.

        The properties that may be set are
        
        * Temperature     (T)
        * Density         (Rho)
        * Volume          (V)
        * Pressure        (P)
        * Enthalpy        (H)
        * Entropy         (S)
        * Mole Fractions  (X)
        * Mass Fractions  (Y)
        * Vapor Fraction  (Vapor)
        * Liquid Fraction (Liquid)
        
        Either the full property name or the symbol may be
        specified. For the extensive properties (V,H,U,S), the values
        must be given per unit mass. H, U, and S must be set in
        conjunction with pressure (for H,S) or volume (for U,S). Either
        (specific) volume or density may be specified. Mole and mass
        fractions must be input as vectors (either row or column) with
        length equal to the number of species. Two properties may be
        specified in a single call to :mat:func:`set`, plus one of
        mass fractions or mole fractions.
        
        Examples::
        
           >> set(gas,'Temperature',600.0);
           >> set(gas,'T',600.0);
           >> set(gas,'T',600.0,'P',2*oneatm,'Y',massfracs);
           >> set(gas,'H',0.5*enthalpy_mass(gas),'P',pressure(gas));
           >> set(gas,'S',entropy_mass(gas),'P',0.5*pressure(gas));
           >> set(gas,'X',ones(nSpecies(gas),1));
           >> set(gas,'T',500.0,'Vapor',0.8)
        
        Alternatively, individual methods to set properties may be
        called (setTemperature, setMoleFractions, etc.)

            Instance of class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase` (or another
            object that derives from ThermoPhase)
        :param varargin:
            Comma separated list of ``property, value`` pairs to be set
        

    .. mat:function:: setDensity(tp, rho)

        Set the density.

        :param tp:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase` (or another
            class derived from ThermoPhase)
        :param rho:

    .. mat:function:: setElectricPotential(tp,phi)

        Set the electric potential.

        :param tp:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase` (or another
            class derived from ThermoPhase)
        :param phi:
            Electric potential. Units: V
        

    .. mat:function:: setMassFractions(tp, y, norm)

        Set the species mass fractions.

        Note that calling :mat:func:`setMassFractions` leaves the temperature and
        density unchanged, and therefore the pressure changes if the new
        composition has a molar mass that is different than the old
        composition. If it is desired to change the composition and hold
        the pressure fixed, use method :mat:func:`set` and specify the mass
        fractions and the pressure, or call :mat:func:`setPressure`
        after calling :mat:func:`setMassFractions`.
        
        :param tp:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase` (or another
            class derived from ThermoPhase)
        :param y:
            Vector of mass fractions whose length must be the same as
            the number of species. Alternatively, a string in the format
            ``'SPEC:Y,SPEC2:Y2'`` that specifies the mass fraction of
            specific species.
        :param norm:
            If ``'nonorm'`` is specified, ``y`` will be normalized. This only
            works if ``y`` is a vector, not a string. Since unnormalized mass
            fractions can lead to unphysical results, ``'nonorm'`` should be
            used only in rare cases, such as computing partial
            derivatives with respect to a species mass fraction.
        

    .. mat:function:: setMoleFractions(tp, x, norm)

        Set the species mole fractions.

        Note that calling :mat:func:`setMoleFractions` leaves the temperature and
        density unchanged, and therefore the pressure changes if the new
        composition has a molar mass that is different than the old
        composition. If it is desired to change the composition and hold
        the pressure fixed, use method :mat:func:`set` and specify the mole
        fractions and the pressure, or call :mat:func:`setPressure`
        after calling :mat:func:`setmoleFractions`.
        
        :param tp:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase` (or another
            class derived from ThermoPhase)
        :param y:
            Vector of mole fractions whose length must be the same as
            the number of species. Alternatively, a string in the format
            ``'SPEC:Y,SPEC2:Y2'`` that specifies the mole fraction of
            specific species.
        :param norm:
            If ``'nonorm'`` is specified, ``y`` will be normalized. This only
            works if ``y`` is a vector, not a string. Since unnormalized mole
            fractions can lead to unphysical results, ``'nonorm'`` should be
            used only in rare cases, such as computing partial
            derivatives with respect to a species mole fraction.

        where :math:`\gamma` is the ratio of specific heats, :math:`R` is

        .. math:: c = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}\right)_s}
        
        where :math:`p` is the pressure and :math:`\rho` is the density,
        and the subscript :math:`s` indicates constant entropy. This is

        The index is an integer assigned to each species in sequence as it
        is read in from the input file.
        
        NOTE: In keeping with the conventions used by Matlab, this method
        returns 1 for the first species, 2 for the second, etc. In
        contrast, the corresponding method speciesIndex in the Cantera C++
        and Python interfaces returns 0 for the first species, 1 for the
        second one, etc. ::
        
            >> ich4 = speciesIndex(gas, 'CH4');
            >> iho2 = speciesIndex(gas, 'HO2');

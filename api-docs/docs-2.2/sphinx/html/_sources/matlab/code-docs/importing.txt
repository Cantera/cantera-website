Solution
--------

.. mat:class:: Solution(src, id, trans)

    Solution class constructor.

    Class :mat:func:`Solution` represents solutions of multiple species. A
    solution is defined as a mixture of two or more constituents
    (species) that are completely mixed on molecular length
    scales. The macroscopic intensive thermodynamic state of a
    solution is specified by two thermodynamic properties (for
    example, the temperature and pressure), and the relative amounts
    of each species, which may be given as mole fractions or mass
    fractions. ::
    
        >> s = Solution('input.xml'[, phase_name[, transport_model]])
    
    constructs a Solution object from a specification contained in
    file ``input.xml``. Optionally, the name of the phase to be imported
    can be specified with ``phase_name``. If a
    Transport model is included in ``input.xml``, it will be included
    in the Solution instance with the default transport modeling as set
    in the input file. To specify the transport modeling, set the input
    argument ``trans`` to one of ``'default'``, ``'Mix'``, or ``'Multi'``.
    In this case, the phase name must be specified as well. Alternatively,
    change the ``transport`` node in the CTML file, or ``transport``
    property inthe CTI file before loading the phase. The transport
    modeling cannot be changed once the phase is loaded.
    
    Class :mat:func:`Solution` derives from three more basic classes, and most of
    its methods are inherited from these classes. These are:
    
        * class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase`  -  composition information and thermodynamic properties
        * class :mat:func:`Kinetics`     -  homogeneous kinetics
        * class :mat:func:`Transport`    -  transport properties
    
    See also: :mat:func:`ThermoPhase`, :mat:func:`Kinetics`, :mat:func:`Transport`
    
    :param src:
        Input string of CTI or CTML file name.
    :param id:
        Optional unless ``trans`` is specified. ID of the phase to
        import as specified in the CTML or CTI file.
    :param trans:
        String, transport modeling. Possible values are ``'default'``,
        ``'Mix'``, or ``'Multi'``. If not specified, ``'default'`` is used.
    :return:
        Instance of class :mat:func:`Solution`
    

    .. mat:function:: IdealGasMix(infile, b, c)

        Create a mixture of ideal gases.

        Create a :mat:func:`Solution` instance representing an ideal gas mixture. ::
        
            gas1 = IdealGasMix('ctml_file'[,'transport_model'])
            gas2 = IdealGasMix('ck_file'[,'thermo_db'[,'tran_db'[,'transport_model']]])
        
        creates an object that represents an ideal gas mixture. The
        species in the mixture, their properties, and the reactions among
        the species, if any, are specified in file 'ctml_file' and 'ck_file'.  Two
        input file formats are supported - CTML and CK
        (CHEMKIN-compatible).  Examples::
        
            g1a = IdealGasMix('mech.xml')
            g1b = IdealGasMix('mech.xml', 'Multi')
            g2 = IdealGasMix('mech2.inp')
            g3 = IdealGasMix('mech3.inp', 'therm.dat')
            g4 = IdealGasMix('mech4.inp', 'therm.dat', 'tran.dat')
        
        Objects ``g1a`` and ``g1b`` are created from a CTML file. CTML files
        contain all data required to build the object, and do not require
        any additional database files. Objects ``g2`` - ``g4`` are created
        from CK-format input files. For ``g2``, 'mech2.inp' contains all required
        species thermo data. File 'mech3.inp' is missing some or all
        species thermo data, and requires database file 'therm.dat.'
        Object ``g4`` is created including transport data.
        
        Note that calling :mat:func:`IdealGasMix` with a CK-format input file
        also creates an equivalent CTML file that may be used in future
        calls. If the initial call includes a transport database, then
        the CTML file will contain transport data.
        
        See also: :mat:func:`ck2cti`, :mat:func:`Solution`
        
        :param infile:
            Input file, either CTI, CTML, or CHEMKIN format
        :param b:
            If a CTI or CTML file is specified with ``infile``, this can be
            the transport modeling to be used. If a CHEMKIN format file is
            specified with ``infile``, this is the filename of the
            thermodynamic database, if required.
        :param c:
            If a CHEMKIN format file is specified with ``infile``, this is the
            filename of the transport database, if required.
        :return:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Solution`
        

    .. mat:function:: importPhase(file, name)

        Import a phase from a CTI file

        See :ref:`sec-phases`.
        
        See also: :mat:func:`Solution`
        
        :param file:
            CTI file containing phase definition
        :param name:
            Name of the phase
        :return:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Solution`
        

Mixture
-------

.. mat:class:: Mixture(phases)

    Multiphase mixture class constructor.

    Class :mat:func:`Mixture` represents mixtures of one or more phases of matter.
    To construct a mixture, supply a cell array of phases and
    mole numbers::
    
        >> gas = importPhase('gas.cti');
        >> graphite = importPhase('graphite.cti');
        >> mix = Mixture({gas, 1.0; graphite, 0.1});
    
    Phases may also be added later using the addPhase method::
    
        >> water = importPhase('water.cti');
        >> addPhase(mix, water, 3.0);
    
    Note that the objects representing each phase compute only the
    intensive state of the phase - they do not store any information
    on the amount of this phase. Mixture objects, on the other hand,
    represent the full extensive state.
    
    Mixture objects are 'lightweight' in the sense that they do not
    store parameters needed to compute thermodynamic or kinetic
    properties of the phases. These are contained in the
    ('heavyweight') phase objects. Multiple mixture objects may be
    constructed using the same set of phase objects. Each one stores
    its own state information locally, and synchronizes the phase
    objects whenever it requires phase properties.
    
    :param phases:
        Cell array of phases and mole numbers
    :return:
        Instance of class :mat:func:`Mixture`
    

    .. mat:function:: addPhase(self, phase, moles)

        :param self:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Mixture` to which phases should be
            added
        :param phase:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`ThermoPhase` which should be added
        :param moles:
            Number of moles of the ``phase`` to be added to this mixture.
            Units: kmol
        

    .. mat:function:: chemPotentials(self)

        Get the chemical potentials of species in a mixture.

        :param self:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Mixture`
        :return:
            Vector of chemical potentials. Units: J/kmol
        

    .. mat:function:: elementIndex(self, name)

        :param name:
            Name of the element whose index is desired
        :return:
            Index of element with name ``name``
        

    .. mat:function:: equilibrate(self, XY, err, maxsteps, maxiter, loglevel)

        Set the mixture to a state of chemical equilibrium.

        This method uses a version of the VCS algorithm to find the
        composition that minimizes the total Gibbs free energy of the
        mixture, subject to element conservation constraints. For a
        description of the theory, see Smith and Missen, "Chemical
        Reaction Equilibrium."  The VCS algorithm is implemented in
        Cantera kernel class MultiPhaseEquil.
        
        The VCS algorithm solves for the equilibrium composition for
        specified temperature and pressure. If any other property pair
        other than "TP" is specified, then an outer iteration loop is
        used to adjust T and/or P so that the specified property
        values are obtained. ::
        
            >> equilibrate(mix, 'TP')
            >> equilibrate('TP', 1.0e-6, 500)
        
        :param self:
            Instance of class :mat:func:`Mixture`
        :param XY:
            Two-letter string specifying the two properties to hold
            fixed.  Currently, ``'TP'``, ``'HP'``, ``'TV'``, and ``'SP'`` are
            implemented. Default: ``'TP'``.
        :param err:
            Error tolerance. Iteration will continue until :math:`\Delta\mu)/RT`
            is less than this value for each reaction. Default:
            1.0e-9. Note that this default is very conservative, and good
            equilibrium solutions may be obtained with larger error
            tolerances.
        :param maxsteps:
            Maximum number of steps to take while solving the
            equilibrium problem for specified T and P. Default: 1000.
        :param maxiter:
            Maximum number of temperature and/or pressure
            iterations.  This is only relevant if a property pair other
            than (T,P) is specified. Default: 200.
        :param loglevel:
            Set to a value > 0 to write diagnostic output.
            Larger values generate more detailed information.
        :return:
            The error in the solution

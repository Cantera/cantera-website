      While Cantera's documentation gives insight into the various classes and functions that
      constitute Cantera's capabilities, software documentation does not always provide a great
      format for diving into scientific theory. This section describes the equations and models
      Cantera uses to represent the real world.

   <h2 class="display-4">Chemical Kinetic Theory</h2>

These sections describe some of the fundamental scientific theory underpinning the ways that Cantera models phases
of matter. This involves calculations for thermodynamic and transport properties and chemical
reaction rates. The above information gives some insight into the basic constitutive models
available in Cantera: capabilities for calculating the basic thermodynamic, chemical kinetic, and transport properties of phases of matter, which can be
extended to model a wide range of science and technology applications.

   <h2 class="display-4">Cantera Reactor and Flame Models</h2>

Cantera comes with a number of zero- and one-dimensional models: reactor and flame models for a
number of well-defined and commonly encountered phenomena.  Below we give an overview of the theory
and and function of these models. You can also see the `Cantera examples </examples/index.html>`__
to see how these models might be used.

               Cantera provides a range of generalized zero-dimensional models that can be given a
               range of initial and boundary conditions and can also be linked to form reactor
               networks.

               Cantera includes a set of models for representing steady-state, quasi-one-dimensional
               reacting flows, which can be used to simulate a number of common flames.

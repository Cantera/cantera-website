      <h1 class="display-3">Other Linux Distributions</h1>

On Linux distributions other than Ubuntu and Gentoo, we recommend that you use the Conda package, described
:ref:`on the Conda installation page <sec-install-conda>`. However, due to the limitations of
distributing binary packages, the Conda package will not work on all Linux distributions (for
instance, RHEL 6 is not supported). For these platforms, or if you want to use an interface other
than the Python interface, you'll have to compile and install Cantera yourself. Instructions for
that are in the :ref:`compiling section <sec-compiling>`.

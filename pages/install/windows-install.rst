      Windows installers are provided for stable versions of Cantera. These installers
      provide the Matlab toolbox and header/library files that can be used to compile
      C++ applications.

To install the Cantera Python package, see the :ref:`pip <sec-install-pip>` or
:ref:`conda <sec-install-conda>` instructions. The Python package is required if:

- You need to work with legacy CTI or XML input files
- You need to convert legacy input files to YAML
- You need to convert Chemkin-format input files to YAML

**Remove old versions of Cantera**

- Use The Windows "Add/Remove Programs" interface to remove previous versions of
  the `Cantera` package.

**Install Cantera**

- Go to the `Cantera Releases <https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/releases>`_
  page and download **Cantera-2.6.0-x64.msi**.

- Run the installer and follow the prompts.

**Configure Matlab**

- If you have also installed the Python module, set the environment variable
  ``PYTHON_CMD`` accordingly.

  - From the *Start* menu, type "edit environment" and select
    "Edit environment variables for your account".
  - Add a *New* variable with ``PYTHON_CMD`` as the *name* and the full path
    to the Python executable (for example, ``C:\python310\python.exe``) as the
    *value*.
  - Setting ``PYTHON_CMD`` is not necessary if the path to ``python.exe`` is
    in your ``PATH`` (which can be set from the same configuration dialog).

- Launch Matlab

- Go to *File->Set Path...*

- Select *Add with Subfolders*

- Browse to the folder ``C:\Program Files\Cantera\matlab\toolbox``

- Select *Save*, then *Close*.

**Test the installation**

- From the Matlab prompt, run:

  .. code-block:: matlab

     gas = IdealGasMix('gri30.yaml')
     h2o = Solution('liquidvapor.yaml', 'water')

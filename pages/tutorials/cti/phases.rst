   .. class:: lead

      Cantera simulations model interactions between and within different phases of matter, as
      described here.

Phases
======

For each phase that appears in a problem, a corresponding entry should be
present in the input file(s). There are several different types of entries,
corresponding to different types of phases, such as ``ideal_gas``,
``ideal_interface``, and ``liquid_vapor``, among others. Phases are created
using one of the directives corresponding to an implemented phase type.

A map with the full listing of available phase types is provided at the `ThermoPhase Class Reference
<{{% ct_docs doxygen/html/dc/d38/classCantera_1_1ThermoPhase.html %}}>`__. However, these phase types
share many common features, and so we will begin by discussing those aspects common to all entries
for phases. The :cti:class:`phase` class contains the features common to all phase types.

Phase Attributes
----------------

Phase Name
^^^^^^^^^^

The ``name`` field is a string that identifies the phase. It must not contain
any whitespace characters or reserved XML characters, and must be unique within
the file among all phase definitions of any type.

Phases are referenced by name when importing them into an application program,
or when defining an interface between phases.

Declaring the Elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The elements that may be present in the phase are declared in the elements
field. This must be a string of element symbols separated by spaces. Each symbol
must either match one listed in the database file ``elements.xml``, or else
match the symbol of an element entry defined elsewhere in the input file (See
the :doc:`cti-species` documentation).

The ``elements.xml`` database contains most elements of the periodic table, with
their natural-abundance atomic masses. It also contains a few isotopes (D, Tr),
and an "element" for an electron (E). This pseudo-element can be used to specify
the composition of charged species. Note that two-character symbols should have
an uppercase first letter, and a lowercase second letter (e.g. ``Cu``, not ``CU``).

It should be noted that the order of the element symbols in the string
determines the order in which they are stored internally by Cantera. For
example, if a phase definition specifies the elements as:

.. code:: python

   s = """ideal_gas(name="gasmix",
                    elements="H C O N Ar",
                    species='gri30:all',
                    )"""

then when this definition is imported by an application, element-specific
properties will be ordered in the same way:

.. code:: python

   >>> import cantera as ct
   >>> gas = ct.Solution(source=s)
   >>> for n, elem in enumerate(gas.element_names):
   ...     print(n, elem)
   0 H
   1 C
   2 O
   3 N
   4 Ar

For some calculations, such as multi-phase chemical equilibrium, it is important
to synchronize the elements among multiple phases, so that each phase contains
the same elements with the same ordering. In such cases, simply use the same
string in the elements field for all phases.

Defining the Species
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The species in the phase are declared in the species field. They are not defined
there, only declared. Species definitions may be imported from other files, or
species may be defined locally using species entries elsewhere in the file.

If a single string of species symbols is given, then it is assumed that these
are locally defined. For each one, a corresponding species entry must be present
somewhere in the file, either preceding or following the phase entry. Note that
the string may extend over multiple lines by delimiting it with triple quotes:

.. code:: python

   species='AR SI Si2 SiH SiH2 SiH3 SiH4'

   # include all species defined in this file
   species='all'

   # a multi-line species declaration
   species=""" H2 H O O2 OH H2O HO2 H2O2 C CH
                 CH2 CH2(S) CH3 CH4 CO CO2 HCO CH2O CH2OH CH3O
                 CH3OH C2H C2H2 C2H3 C2H4 C2H5 C2H6 HCCO CH2CO HCCOH
                 N NH NH2 NH3 NNH NO NO2 N2O HNO CN
                 HCN H2CN HCNN HCNO HOCN HNCO NCO N2 AR C3H7
                 C3H8 CH2CHO CH3CHO """

If the species are imported from another file, instead of being defined locally,
then the string should begin with the file name (without extension), followed by
a colon:

.. code:: python

   # import selected species from silicon.xml
   species="silicon: SI SI2 SIH SIH2 SIH3 SIH4 SI2H6"

   # import all species from silicon.xml
   species="silicon: all"

In this case, the species definitions will be taken from file ``silicon.xml``,
which must exist either in the local directory or somewhere on the Cantera
search path.

It is also possible to import species from several sources, or mix local
definitions with imported ones, by specifying a sequence of strings:

.. code:: python

   species=["CL2 CL F F2 HF HCL",  # defined in this file
            "air: O2 N2 NO",  # imported from 'air.xml'
            "ions: CL- F-"]  # imported from 'ions.xml'

Note that the strings must be separated by commas, and enclosed in square
brackets or parentheses.

Declaring the Reactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reactions are declared in the ``reactions`` field. Just as
with species, reactions may be defined locally in the file, or may be imported
from one or more other files. All reactions must only involve species that have
been declared for the phase.

Unlike species, reactions do not have a name, but do have an optional ``ID``
field. If the ``ID`` field is not assigned a value, then when the reaction entry
is read it will be assigned a four-digit string encoding the reaction number,
beginning with ``'0001'`` for the first reaction in the file, and incrementing
by one for each new reaction.

If all reactions defined locally in the input file are to be included in the
phase definition, then assign the ``reactions`` field the string ``'all'``:

.. code:: python

   reactions='all'

If, on the other hand, only some of the reactions defined in the file are to be
included, then a range can be specified using the reaction ``ID`` fields:

.. code:: python

   reactions='nox-12 to nox-24'

In determining which reactions to include, a lexical comparison of id strings is
performed. This means, for example, that ``'nox-8'`` is greater than
``'nox-24'``. (If it is rewritten ``'nox-08'``, however, then it would be lexically
less than ``'nox-24'``.)

Just as described above for species, reactions can be imported from another
file, and reactions may be imported from several sources. Examples:

.. code:: python

   # import all reactions defined in this file
   reactions="all"

   # import all reactions defined in rxns.xml
   reactions="rxns: all"

   # import reactions 1-14 in rxns.xml
   reactions="rxns: 0001 to 0014"

   # import reactions from several sources
   reactions=["all",  # all local reactions
              "gas: all",  # all reactions in gas.xml
              "nox: n005 to n008"]  # reactions 5 to 8 in nox.xml

The Kinetics Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *kinetics model* is a set of equations to use to compute reaction rates. In
most cases, each type of phase has an associated kinetics model that is used by
default, and so the ``kinetics`` field does not need to be assigned a value. For
example, the :cti:class:`ideal_gas` entry has an associated kinetics model called
``GasKinetics`` that implements mass-action kinetics, computes reverse rates
from thermochemistry for reversible reactions, and provides various
pressure-independent and pressure-dependent reaction types. Other models could
be implemented, and this field would then be used to select the desired
model. For now, the ``kinetics`` field can be safely ignored.

The Transport Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *transport model* is a set of equations used to compute transport
properties. For :cti:class:`ideal_gas` phases, multiple transport models are
available; the one desired can be selected by assigning a string to this
field. See :ref:`Transport Models <sec-transport-models>` for more details.

The Initial State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The phase may be assigned an initial state to which it will be set when the
definition is imported into an application and an object created. This is done
by assigning field ``initial_state`` an embedded entry of type :cti:func:`state`.

For example, I can set the initial state of an object representing air, using
the following entry:

.. code:: python

   initial_state=state(temperature=300.0,
                         pressure=OneAtm,
                         mole_fractions='O2:0.21, N2:0.78, AR:0.01')


Most of the attributes defined here are "immutable," meaning that once the definition has been
imported into an application, they cannot be changed by the application. For example, it is not
possible to change the elements or the species. The temperature, pressure, and composition, however,
are "mutable"â€”they can be changed. This is why the field defining the state is called the
``initial_state``; the object in the application will be initially set to this state, but it may be
changed at any time.

Complete example: Air
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The full range of options described above are demonstrated below for an ideal
gas representing air. This entry comes directly from the ``air.cti`` file
that is included with Cantera:

.. code:: python

   ideal_gas(name="air",
             elements=" O  N  Ar ",
             species=""" O  O2  N  NO  NO2  N2O  N2  AR """,
             reactions="all",
             transport="Mix",
             initial_state=state(temperature=300.0,
                                 pressure=OneAtm,
                                 mole_fractions='O2:0.21, N2:0.78, AR:0.01'))

Interfaces
==========

Now that we have seen how to define bulk, three-dimensional phases, we can
describe the procedure to define an interface between phases. Cantera presently
implements a simple model for an interface that treats it as a two-dimensional
ideal solution of interfacial species.

The entry type for this interface model is :cti:class:`ideal_interface` (Additional interface models
may be added to allow non-ideal, coverage-dependent properties). Defining an interface is much like
defining a phase, but there are two new fields: ``phases`` and ``site_density``.

- The ``phases`` field specifies the bulk phases that participate in the
  heterogeneous reactions. In most cases this string will list one or two
  phases, but no limit is placed on the number.

- The ``site_density`` field is the number of adsorption sites per unit area.

Another new aspect is in the embedded :cti:class:`state` entry in the
``initial_state`` field. When specifying the initial state of an interface, the
:cti:class:`state` entry has a field *coverages*, which can be assigned a string
specifying the initial surface species coverages:

.. code:: python

   ideal_interface(name='silicon_surface',
                   elements='Si H',
                   species='s* s-SiH3 s-H',
                   reactions='all',
                   phases='gas bulk-Si',
                   site_density=(1.0e15, 'molec/cm2'),
                   initial_state=state(temperature=1200.0,
                                       coverages='s-H:0.65, s*:0.35'))

Special Processing Options
==========================

The options field is used to indicate how certain conditions should be handled
when importing the phase definition. The options field may be assigned a string
or a sequence of strings from the table below.

==================================  ========================================================
Option String                       Meaning
==================================  ========================================================
``'skip_undeclared_elements'``      When importing species, skip any containing undeclared
                                    elements, rather than flagging them as an error.
``'skip_undeclared_species'``       When importing reactions, skip any containing undeclared
                                    species, rather than flagging them as an error.
``'skip_undeclared_third_bodies'``  When importing reactions with third body efficiencies,
                                    ignore any efficiencies for undeclared species, rather
                                    than flagging them as an error.
``'allow_discontinuous_thermo'``    Disable the automatic adjustment of NASA polynomials to
                                    eliminate discontinuities in enthalpy and entropy at the
                                    midpoint temperature.
==================================  ========================================================

Using the ``options`` field, it is possible to extract a sub-mechanism from a large
reaction mechanism, as follows:

.. code:: python

   ideal_gas(name='hydrogen_mech',
             elements='H O',
             species='gri30:all',
             reactions='gri30:all',
             options=('skip_undeclared_elements',
                      'skip_undeclared_species',
                      'skip_undeclared_third_bodies'))

If we import this into Matlab, for example, we get a gas mixture containing the
8 species (out of 53 total) that contain only H and O:

.. code:: matlab

   >> gas = Solution('gas.cti', 'hydrogen_mech')

     hydrogen_mech:

          temperature           0.001  K

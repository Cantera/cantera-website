      A guide to Cantera's legacy CTI input file format

      Note that the legacy CTI input file format was deprecated in Cantera 2.5 in
      favor of the :doc:`YAML <defining-phases>` input format, and will be removed
      in Cantera 3.0.

Virtually every Cantera simulation involves one or more phases of
matter. Depending on the calculation being performed, it may be necessary to
evaluate thermodynamic properties, transport properties, and/or homogeneous
reaction rates for the phase(s) present. Before the properties can be evaluated,
each phase must be defined, meaning that the models to use to compute its
properties and reaction rates must be specified, along with any parameters the
models require.

Because the amount of data required can be quite large, this data is imported
from a text file that can be read by the application, so that a given
phase model can be re-used for other simulations. This is the Cantera
Input (CTI) file.

This guide describes how to write such files to define phases and interfaces for
use in Cantera simulations. Each link below represents a standalone module -
while you certainly can read them in order, you can also jump to whichever
section addresses your current needs. If you need tips on troubleshooting the
CTI file syntax rules, please look at the :doc:`CTI syntax tutorial <cti-syntax>`.

            For each phase that appears in a problem, a corresponding entry should be present in the
            input file(s). We'll start by describing the entries for phases of various types, and
            then look at how to define interfaces between phases.

         .. container:: card-text

            For each species declared as part of a phase description, both the species and the
            elements that it is comprised of must be defined. Here, we describe how both are
            defined.

      .. container:: card-body

         .. container:: card-text

            Cantera supports a number of different types of reactions, including several types of
            homogeneous reactions, surface reactions, and electrochemical reactions. For each, there
            is a corresponding entry type. Here, we describe how to declare each type of reaction
            and provide the necessary parameters to calculate the reaction rate for each.

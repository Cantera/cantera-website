      Packages in the Cantera ecosystem

While Cantera provides some standalone models and applications, numerous external packages
exist that provide more specialized functionality and rely on Cantera. Here we provide a
non-exhaustive, alphabetical, list of these packages; if you would like us to include your package, please
`submit a pull request <https://github.com/cantera/cantera-website/pulls>`__,
`file an issue <https://github.com/cantera/cantera-website/issues/new>`__, or
post on the `Google Users' Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cantera-users>`__.

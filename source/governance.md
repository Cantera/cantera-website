# Cantera Governance

This document outlines the policies and procedures that manage the Cantera community.

## Code of Conduct

All online and in-person interactions and communications related to Cantera are governed
by the [Cantera Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
This code of conduct sets expectations for the community to ensure that users and
contributors are able to participate in a respectful and welcoming environment.

## Teams & Roles

Steering Committee
: This is the governing body of Cantera, making decisions regarding the structure,
  operations, and long-term direction of the project. Each member has one vote for
  important project decisions.

Committers
: Members of the committers team have commit/push access to the Cantera source code,
  and can merge pull requests.

Cantera Users' Group moderators
: Members of the moderators team moderate the Users' Group, and have power to
  enable/disable posting of community members at their discretion.

## Current Steering Committee

The role of the steering committee is to ensure the long-term health of the Cantera
project. This includes overseeing the development of the Cantera code and community in a
way that most benefits the entire community of users and contributors. The steering
committee can be contacted at [steering@cantera.org](mailto:steering@cantera.org). The
current steering committee (in alphabetical order) is:

- Steven DeCaluwe (2018–)

- C. Franklin Goldsmith (2018–)
- Kyle Niemeyer (2018–)

The Steering Committee should have at least five members. Members serve in two-year
cycles (starting in November 2018), with the ability to reaffirm their membership at the
end of each cycle without a committee vote or leave the committee at their discretion.
Members can also choose to leave the committee at any time.

2/3 majority. All members should vote, but abstentions are permitted.

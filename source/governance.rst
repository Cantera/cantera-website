      Policies and procedures governing the Cantera community

Cantera Governance
------------------

This document outlines the policies and procedures that manage the Cantera community.

Code of Conduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All online and in-person interactions and communications related to Cantera are
governed by the `Cantera Code of Conduct
<https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__. This code
of conduct sets expectations for the community to ensure that users and
contributors are able to participate in a respectful and welcoming environment.

Teams & Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Steering Committee**
    This is the governing body of Cantera, making decisions regarding the structure,
    operations, and long-term direction of the project. Each member has one vote for
    important project decisions.

**Committers**
    Members of the committers team have commit/push access to the Cantera source code,
    and can merge pull requests.

**Cantera User Group moderators**
    Members of the moderators team moderate the User Group, and have power to
    enable/disable posting of community members at their discretion.

Current Steering Committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The role of the steering committee is to ensure the long-term health of the
Cantera project. This includes overseeing the development of the Cantera code
and community in a way that most benefits the entire community of users and

The Steering Committee should have at least five members. Members serve in two-year
cycles (starting in November 2018), with the ability to reaffirm their membership
at the end of each cycle without a committee vote or leave the committee at
their discretion. Members can also choose to leave the committee at any time.

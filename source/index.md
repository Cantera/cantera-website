:::{grid-item}

#### Automation

Cantera automates the chemical kinetic, thermodynamic, and transport calculations so that the users can efficiently incorporate detailed chemical thermo-kinetics and transport models into their calculations.
:::

:::{grid-item}

#### Object-Oriented

Cantera utilizes object-oriented concepts for robust yet flexible phase models, and algorithms are generalized so that users can explore different phase models with minimal changes to their overall code.
:::

:::{grid-item}

#### Multiple Interfaces

Cantera can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written in C/C++ and Fortran 90.
:::

:::{grid-item}

#### Broad Applications

Cantera is currently used for applications including combustion, detonations, electrochemical energy conversion and storage, fuel cells, batteries, aqueous electrolyte solutions, plasmas, and thin film deposition.

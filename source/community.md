## About the Cantera Community

Cantera was originally developed by {doc}`Prof. David G. Goodwin <dave-goodwin>` at the
California Institute of Technology. Building on Prof. Goodwin's legacy, Cantera is
licensed under a [permissive 3-Clause BSD license](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/blob/main/License.txt),
ensuring that the software will remain open source and available for all to use.

In this vein, Cantera software relies exclusively upon the volunteer contributions of
its users. These contributions range from diagnosing and reporting problems/bugs, to
helping others learn to use Cantera, to developing and implementing new software
capabilities. For a brief overview, see our {doc}`getting involved <getting-involved>`
page.

While Cantera provides some standalone models and applications, numerous external
packages exist that provide more specialized functionality and rely on Cantera. We
provide a non-exhaustive list of these {doc}`affiliated packages <affiliated>`.

### Governance

Cantera is governed by a Steering Committee; more information about our project's
governance policies can be found on the {doc}`governance <governance>` page.

### The Cantera Users' Group

The [Cantera Usersâ€™ Group](https://groups.google.com/g/cantera-users) on Google Groups
is the forum where most Cantera users have their questions asked and answered. If you
need help using Cantera and cannot find an answer in the tutorials or documentation at
Cantera's website, consider joining and asking a question there. A few notes:

- Please use the search feature before posting to see if your question has been answered
  before.
- If you are not running the current stable release of Cantera, please upgrade first,
  and see if the problem persists.
- This group is moderated, so it may take some time for your posts to appear if you are
  a new member.

For installation/compilation problems, please provide:

- The contents of the `cantera.conf` and `config.log` files, and the output of the
  `scons build` and `scons build dump` commands. You can direct this output to a file
  called `buildlog.txt` by running:

  ```
  scons build >buildlog.txt 2>&1
  ```

- The exact version of Cantera you are trying to compile, and how it was
  obtained (for example, downloaded source tarball or the specific Git commit).

- Your operating system, compiler versions, and the versions of any other relevant
  software.

For application problems (that is, not related to installation or compilation), please:

- Provide a minimal, complete, and verifiable example that demonstrates the problem when
  making your post; in short this means include a code example and input files.
- Please also provide information about your operating system and Cantera version. This
  will enable other members of the group to efficiently understand the problem and offer
  suggestions on how to fix it.
- *Please do not post screenshots of code or error messages!* They cannot be searched by
  anyone looking to solve a similar problem, and also cannot be read by text readers for
  visually impaired users. Instead, please copy and paste any relevant text directly
  into your message. Thanks!
